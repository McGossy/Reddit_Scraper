# Reddit_Scraper
Scrapes data from a few of Reddit's most popular subreddits. We chose the top 1000 posts over the last year from these subreddits:
              <ul>
              <li>/r/popular</li>
              <li>/r/news</li>
              <li>/r/politics</li>
              <li>/r/worldnews</li>
              <li>/r/science</li>
              </ul>
              
This site allows you to view the most common words, dates, and allows you to search through both of those categories.
